# ADR-007: Kafka Topic Naming and Event Schema Evolution

## Status

**Accepted** (2026-08-27)

Extends [ADR-002](002-shared-contracts-versioning-strategy.md), which versions the shared-contracts
*artifact* but says nothing about the wire.

## Context

Vaullet is event-driven by design, and [ADR-005](005-module-composition-and-deployment-topology.md)
makes that load-bearing commercially: modules are removable precisely *because* they communicate only
through events. That only holds if the event layer itself has rules.

### The gap ADR-002 leaves

ADR-002 gives the `wallet-shared-contracts` artifact a semantic version and tests backward
compatibility at build time. That is a **library** guarantee, not a **wire** guarantee. They are
different problems:

- A consumer running contracts `v2.1` will read events produced by a service on `v2.9`. Semver on the
  jar says nothing about whether that deserialises.
- Events already written to a topic cannot be recompiled. A field removed in `v3.0` still exists in
  three weeks of retained messages.
- Under polyrepo deployment there is **no controlled upgrade order**. Producer-first and
  consumer-first must both be safe, because either can happen.

### What is actually in use today

Auditing every event named across `arch.md` and ADRs 001–006 turned up a naming layer that grew by
accretion:

| Pattern | Examples | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| PascalCase | `ValueGranted` | The single most load-bearing event in the system, and it matches nothing else |
| Kebab in a segment | `recurring-payment.due` | Mixes separators against the dot-case majority |
| Two segments | `transaction.created`, `bonus.applied` | Fine |
| Three segments | `transaction.status.updated`, `fraud.suspicion.detected` | Inconsistent depth; `fraud.case.created` and `fraud.pattern.detected` disagree about what the middle segment means |
| No version anywhere | all of them | No path to a breaking change that is not an outage |

None of this is broken yet because none of it is built. It is exactly the moment to fix it.

### Constraints

- No controlled deploy order between services
- A customer's cluster runs only the modules they bought — topics may have zero consumers, and that
  must cost nothing
- Financial events may not be silently dropped
- ADR-003 asserts `datawarehouse_db` is rebuildable from the event stream

## Decision

### 1. Topic naming

```
<domain>.<event-name>.v<major>
```

- **`<domain>`** — the owning bounded context, singular, lowercase. The service that *produces* the
  event, never the one that consumes it.
- **`<event-name>`** — past tense, describing something that already happened. An event is a fact.
- **`v<major>`** — schema major version. See §4.

**Separator rule**: dots separate segments; hyphens separate words *within* a segment. Never
underscores — Kafka collides `.` and `_` in JMX metric names, and a topic named `a.b_c` and one named
`a_b.c` produce the same metric.

Exactly three segments. Always.

### 2. The renaming

| Current | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `ValueGranted` | `rewards.value-granted.v1` |
| `transaction.created` | `transaction.created.v1` |
| `transaction.approved` | `transaction.approved.v1` |
| `transaction.completed` | `transaction.completed.v1` |
| `transaction.failed` | `transaction.failed.v1` |
| `transaction.status.updated` | *removed* — superseded by the explicit lifecycle events above |
| `refund.initiated` / `.completed` / `.failed` | `refund.initiated.v1` / `refund.completed.v1` / `refund.failed.v1` |
| `ledger.entry.recorded` | `ledger.entry-recorded.v1` |
| `ledger.balance.updated` | `ledger.balance-updated.v1` |
| `ledger.settlement.rejected` | `ledger.settlement-rejected.v1` |
| `fraud.analysis.completed` | `fraud.analysis-completed.v1` |
| `fraud.suspicion.detected` | `fraud.suspicion-detected.v1` |
| `fraud.pattern.detected` | `fraud.pattern-detected.v1` |
| `fraud.case.created` / `.reviewed` | `risk.case-created.v1` / `risk.case-reviewed.v1` |
| `account.locked` / `.unlocked` | `risk.account-locked.v1` / `risk.account-unlocked.v1` |
| `bonus.applied` / `.revoked` / `.expired` | `bonus.applied.v1` / `bonus.revoked.v1` / `bonus.expired.v1` |
| `bonus.wagering.completed` | `bonus.wagering-completed.v1` |
| `loyalty.tier.changed` | `loyalty.tier-changed.v1` |
| `loyalty.points.redeemed` | `loyalty.points-redeemed.v1` |
| `referral.completed` | `referral.completed.v1` |
| `subscription.created` / `.suspended` | `subscription.created.v1` / `subscription.suspended.v1` |
| `recurring-payment.due` | `scheduler.payment-due.v1` |
| `recurring-payment.processed` | *removed* — the outcome is `transaction.completed.v1` |
| `limit.threshold.reached` | `limits.threshold-reached.v1` |
| `user.registered` | `auth.user-registered.v1` |

Two deletions are substantive rather than cosmetic:

**`transaction.status.updated` is removed.** A generic "something changed" event forces every consumer
to re-derive what happened by inspecting the payload, which is how consumers end up coupled to the
producer's state machine. The explicit lifecycle events already carry the meaning.

**`recurring-payment.processed` is removed.** `arch.md` previously had Subscription Service processing
its own payment and announcing the result; that duplicated the money path and was corrected so
Subscription requests a transaction like any other client. There is one event for money having moved,
and it is `transaction.completed.v1`. Two would drift.

Note `fraud.case.*` and `account.*` move to the `risk.` domain: Risk Management produces them, and the
domain segment names the producer.

### 3. The envelope

Every event carries the same envelope. Only `payload` varies.

```json
{
  "event_id":       "evt_01J8…",
  "event_type":     "transaction.completed",
  "schema_version": "1.4.0",
  "occurred_at":    "2026-08-27T14:32:11.482Z",
  "producer":       { "service": "transaction-service", "version": "2.3.1" },
  "correlation_id": "cor_01J8…",
  "causation_id":   "evt_01J8…",
  "account_id":     "acct_0f9c…",
  "payload":        { }
}
```

- **`event_id`** makes consumers idempotent. Kafka is at-least-once; every consumer that changes state
  must dedupe on this. Vaullet's ledger already enforces this at the database level (ADR-004) — the
  envelope generalises it to every consumer.
- **`correlation_id`** spans one user-initiated flow; **`causation_id`** is the `event_id` that caused
  this one. Together they reconstruct a full causal chain across services, which is what makes an
  event-driven system debuggable at 3am.
- **`schema_version`** is the full semver of the payload schema, distinct from the `v<major>` in the
  topic name.

### 4. Versioning: topic-per-major

**Additive, optional changes stay on the same topic.** New optional field, new enum value handled by a
documented default — same topic, minor version bump.

**Anything else gets a new topic.** Removing a field, renaming one, tightening a type, changing a
meaning: produce to `<domain>.<event>.v2`, dual-publish to both during migration, retire `v1` when its
consumer lag is zero and stays zero.

Breaking changes become a visible, gradual, reversible operational event rather than a coordinated
flag-day across a polyrepo. The cost is dual-publishing during migration; the alternative is
synchronised deploys, which ADR-005's independent-module model rules out.

**Schema Registry compatibility: `FULL_TRANSITIVE`.** Not `BACKWARD` (assumes consumers upgrade first)
and not `FORWARD` (assumes producers do). With independent deploys there is no order to assume, so
both directions must hold, against *all* prior versions rather than just the previous one — a chain of
individually-compatible steps is not itself compatible. `FULL_TRANSITIVE` mechanically enforces "only
additive and optional", which is precisely the rule above, so the registry rejects violations at
publish time rather than a reviewer catching them.

### 5. Format: JSON Schema

JSON on the wire, JSON Schema in the registry.

ADR-002 already generates TypeScript from Java DTOs for the frontend; JSON keeps one representation
end to end. Avro is more compact and has the better registry story, but its TypeScript support is
weak, and at >1000 TPS the payload-size difference is not the constraint. Debuggability — reading a
message off a topic during an incident without tooling — matters more at this scale.

Revisit if throughput reaches the point where serialisation cost is measurable.

### 6. Partitioning and ordering

**Key every account-scoped event by `account_id`.** Kafka orders within a partition only, so this is
what guarantees a grant lands before the spend that draws on it.

Events not scoped to an account key on their own aggregate id (`campaign_id`, `job_id`). Never key on
`event_id` — a unique key spreads one aggregate across every partition and destroys ordering.

**Partitions**: 12 for money-movement topics, 3 elsewhere. Partition count can be increased but never
decreased, and increasing it changes key-to-partition mapping — so this is closer to a one-way door
than it looks, and 12 is deliberate headroom rather than a current requirement.

### 7. Consumer groups

`<service-name>` — one group per service, matching the deployment unit. A module that isn't deployed
has no consumer group, so it raises no lag alerts and costs nothing (ADR-005).

Where one service consumes a topic for two independent purposes, `<service-name>.<purpose>`.

### 8. Retention

| Topic class | Retention | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Money movement (`transaction.*`, `ledger.*`, `refund.*`, `rewards.*`, `bonus.*`) | **Tiered, indefinite** | See below |
| Risk and fraud (`fraud.*`, `risk.*`) | 90 days | Investigation window |
| Operational (`limits.*`, `auth.*`, `scheduler.*`) | 7 days | Transport only |
| Config / state-carrying | Compacted | Latest value per key is the point |

**Kafka is transport, not the system of record.** `vaullet_db` is the ledger; Audit Service is the
compliance record. Retention exists for replay and rebuild, not durability of truth.

**On indefinite retention for money topics** — this is not a preference, it is a dependency.
[ADR-003](003-hybrid-database-strategy-with-analytics.md) states `datawarehouse_db` is rebuildable
from events with a 2-hour recovery objective. Under a 7-day retention that claim silently degrades to
"rebuildable for the last 7 days", which is not a rebuild; it is a gap nobody notices until a rebuild
is attempted under pressure. Either the events outlive the warehouse or ADR-003's recovery story is
false. Tiered storage (local SSD hot, object storage cold) makes indefinite retention affordable, and
the alternative — sourcing rebuilds from operational databases — reintroduces exactly the coupling
ADR-003 separated them to avoid.

### 9. Retry and dead letters

`<topic>.retry` (delayed redelivery, exponential backoff, capped at 5 attempts) and `<topic>.dlq`.

**Financial events are never dropped.** A message reaching a DLQ pages someone; it does not increment
a counter on a dashboard nobody watches. DLQ depth > 0 on a money-movement topic is an alert, not a
metric. Replay is manual and audited, because automatic replay of a poison pill reproduces the
failure.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

✅ **Breaking changes have a safe path** — a new topic and a migration window instead of a flag-day
✅ **No deploy-order assumption** — `FULL_TRANSITIVE` makes producer-first and consumer-first equally safe
✅ **Consumers can be idempotent** — `event_id` in every envelope, which at-least-once delivery makes mandatory
✅ **Flows are traceable across services** — correlation and causation reconstruct the causal chain
✅ **Ordering is guaranteed where money depends on it** — account-keyed partitioning
✅ **Undeployed modules stay free** — no consumer group, no lag, no alert
✅ **The registry enforces the rule** — violations fail at publish, not at review
✅ **One naming convention** — `ValueGranted` no longer stands alone

### Negative Consequences

⚠️ **`FULL_TRANSITIVE` is strict.** Some genuinely reasonable changes will require a new topic. That
strictness is the point, but it will feel heavy the first time a trivial-looking rename needs a v2.

⚠️ **Dual-publishing during migrations** means a period of writing every affected event twice, with
the storage and complexity that implies.

⚠️ **Indefinite retention on money topics costs money.** Tiered storage reduces it substantially but
does not remove it, and under single-tenant deployment the cost is per customer cluster.

⚠️ **Envelope overhead on every message** — roughly 300 bytes before payload. Immaterial at current
volume; worth revisiting alongside the Avro question if it ever isn't.

⚠️ **A rename touches every document.** `ValueGranted` appears in ADRs 004 and 005 and in `arch.md`,
and all of them must move together or the docs contradict each other again.

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Producer bypasses the registry | Unvalidated schema reaches consumers | Registry is mandatory in the serialiser config; CI asserts every produced type is registered |
| Topic created ad hoc by auto-creation | Wrong partitions, wrong retention, name off-convention | `auto.create.topics.enable=false`; topics are Terraform, reviewed like any other infrastructure |
| v1 retired while a consumer still reads it | Silent data loss for that consumer | Retire only after consumer lag is zero *and* the group has been inactive for 7 days |
| DLQ accumulates unnoticed | Money events lost in practice | Depth > 0 on a money topic pages; dashboard-only alerting is explicitly insufficient |
| Partition count increased on a keyed topic | Ordering breaks across the resize | Treat as a migration with a new topic, not an in-place change |
| Consumers dedupe in memory | Duplicates after a restart | Dedupe state must be durable — a database constraint, as ADR-004 does |

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Version in the payload only, never in the topic name

**Description**: One topic per event type forever; consumers branch on `schema_version`.

**Pros**: Fewer topics; no dual-publishing; no migration choreography.

**Cons**: Every consumer accumulates version-handling branches that are never removed, because nobody
can prove the old version has stopped arriving. The compatibility burden shifts from the platform to
every consumer, and it never expires.

**Why rejected**: It makes breaking changes *possible* rather than *safe*, and pushes the cost onto
the consumers least equipped to carry it.

---

### Alternative 2: Avro with Schema Registry

**Description**: Binary Avro instead of JSON.

**Pros**: Compact; the canonical Kafka pairing; strongest schema evolution tooling; registry
integration is first-class rather than bolted on.

**Cons**: TypeScript support is materially weaker, and ADR-002 commits to generated TypeScript for
frontends. Messages become unreadable without tooling, which matters during incidents.

**Why rejected — provisionally**: The right choice at high throughput, and a contained change if
throughput arrives. At current volume, debuggability and one representation end-to-end are worth more
than bytes on the wire.

---

### Alternative 3: No schema registry; rely on ADR-002's shared contracts

**Description**: The shared-contracts artifact is the schema; compatibility is a build-time concern.

**Pros**: One less component per cluster; ADR-002 already tests compatibility.

**Cons**: Compiles against a schema, but does not validate what is actually on the topic. A service
that skips a contracts upgrade, or a hand-rolled producer, is caught by nothing. Retained messages
outlive the artifact version that wrote them.

**Why rejected**: Build-time compatibility and runtime compatibility are different guarantees, and
only the runtime one prevents the incident.

---

### Alternative 4: Event names as `<verb>.<noun>` or command-style

**Description**: `create.transaction`, or imperative names.

**Pros**: Reads naturally in code.

**Cons**: Imperative names invite treating events as commands, which is how choreography quietly
becomes orchestration — a producer starts caring who acts on its event. Past tense keeps events facts
about the past that anyone may ignore, which is exactly what makes modules removable under ADR-005.

**Why rejected**: The naming would undermine the property the architecture depends on.

## Implementation Notes

### Topic provisioning

Terraform, in `wallet-infrastructure`, with partition count and retention per topic class. Auto-creation
disabled in every environment. A module's topics are provisioned with the module (ADR-005), so a
customer without Bonus has no `bonus.*` topics.

### Registry configuration

```properties
schema.registry.url=http://schema-registry:8081
value.subject.name.strategy=io.confluent.kafka.serializers.subject.TopicRecordNameStrategy
auto.register.schemas=false      # CI registers; runtime never does
use.latest.version=false
```

`auto.register.schemas=false` is the important line: a service that could register its own schema
could register an incompatible one at 3am.

### CI enforcement

1. Every event class in `wallet-shared-contracts` maps to a registered subject — fail the build otherwise
2. Schema compatibility checked against `FULL_TRANSITIVE` before publish
3. Topic names linted against `^[a-z]+\.[a-z][a-z-]*\.v[0-9]+$`
4. Every consumer of a state-changing event has a durable dedupe on `event_id` — asserted by an
   architecture test, since this is the rule most likely to be quietly skipped

### Follow-up: the rename must propagate

`ValueGranted` appears in ADR-004, ADR-005 and `arch.md`; the `fraud.case.*` → `risk.*` move and the
`recurring-payment.*` retirement affect `arch.md`. These are documentation changes to make alongside
this ADR, not after it.
